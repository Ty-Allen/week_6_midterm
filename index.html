			<p>Books have been around for much longer than movies and for good reason. Reading books is much better than watching a movie of the same book. Books allow for more details and greater story while movies are forced to sum it up in about 2 hours. Books are also more accesible than movies. They are meant to be portable and can be picked up or put down at anytime. Movies are also portable with phones, but in public spaces you need stuff such as headphones to not annoy people, which makes movies more inconvenient. Finally, many books are cheaper than buying/renting movies or going to the movie theatre which means more people can access them and more money to spend on more books. </p>
